                  ** SeqAn Build System and Support Files **

Description
===========

This directory contains the SeqAn CMake build system and supporting files.  We
will give a rough overview of the most important files and mechanisms used in
the build system.  It should be fairly easy to understand the system from the
documentation embedded in the CMake files.

Files
=====

  FindTBB

    Copy from http://code.google.com/p/findtbb/ of the TBB finder.

  CMakeMacroParseArguments.cmake

   Makes writing CMake find modules easier.  Copied from CMake project, not
   available in older CMake versions.

  CTestConfig.cmake

    This file is copied into the project root in nightly builds for
    configuration.

  FeatureSummary.cmake

    Print a summary of the features enabled in the SeqAn library.

  FindBZip2.cmake

    Contains the functionality from FindZLIB.cmake for libbz2.

  FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake

    See CMakeMacroParseArguments.cmake.

  GetCurrentDate.cmake

    Get the current date into ${CURRENT_YEAR}, ${CURRENT_MONTH}, and
    ${CURRENT_DAY}.

  package.cmake

    CPack configuration for the SeqAn library/all-apps builds.

  SeqAnBuildSystem.cmake

    This CMake file defines various functions and macros to be used in the
    SeqAn file hierarchy.  They form the SeqAn build system.

  SeqAnContribs.cmake

    Included from the root CMakeLists.txt, looks for the SeqAn contribs on
    windows in their default install locations.

  SeqAnLegacyBuildSystem.cmake

   This CMake file defines functions from the previous build system.  They are
   translated to the functions from SeqAnBuildSystem.cmake for backward
   compatibility and a smoother upgrade path.

  SeqAnUsabilityAnalyzer.cmake

   CMake functions that allow for the integration of the SeqAn Usability
   Analyzer (SUA) into the build process.

  FindZLIB.cmake

    A CMake module for finding the ZLIB.  This is a copy of the original
    FindZLIB.cmake from the CMake project.  The main difference is that the
    libraries are searched for in an optimized version (no suffix) and a debug
    version (suffix "_d").

    This is relevant on Windows where you can only link against libraries
    build in the same optimization configuration.

    Note that you can such compiled libraries from the SeqAn Contribs.

  SetCPackSystemName.cmake

    Include to set the system name into CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME.
