@page Index SeqAn API Documentation

SeqAn is the open source C++ library of efficient algorithms and data structures for the analysis of sequences with the focus on biological data.
SeqAn applies a unique generic design that guarantees high performance, generality, extensibility, and integration with other libraries.
SeqAn is easy to use and simplifies the development of new software tools with a minimal loss of performance.

This is the API documentation of the library.
